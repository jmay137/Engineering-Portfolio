# HPR Safety Checker
# Overview

 The High Power Rocketry Safety Checker is a C++ application I wrote as my final project for my Advanced Programming course. It's purpose is to determine whether the high power rocket you've designed is safe to fly or not, by taking in the parameters of your rocket and calculating key parameters.  
  
One of the parameters calculated is Stability, which requires your center of pressure. This can be calculated via a set of equations called the Barrowman Equations, which provide a simple algebraic solution for calculating the center of pressure for a sounding rocket. These equations were developed by James S. Barrowman as part of his Masters Thesis, and are used by hobby rocketeers every day.  
  
​Once stability and a number of other parameters are checked, the software lets you know if your rocket is deemed theoretically safe to fly or not.

Specifications
- Written in c++
- Utilizes OOP for tracking rocket parameters
