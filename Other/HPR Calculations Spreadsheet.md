# HPR Calculations Spreadsheet
# Overview
HPR Calculations Spreadsheet is a spreadsheet based tool that makes it as easy as possible to design a high power rocket, by compiling all the necessary calculations into one user friendly place.  
  
After spending 3 years learning the ins and outs of High Power Rocketry, I got sick of rummaging through textbooks, forum posts, and countless rules of thumb to figure out the math required to design a high power rocket. So I decided to save myself and my team the trouble by compiling every calculation necessary to build a basic high power rocket into one singular, easy to use spreadsheet.
