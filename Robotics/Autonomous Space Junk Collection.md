After training the model for about a week, I was able to evaluate and see how well it had performed. It was not able to properly grab an object, but it did show some interesting behavior. A summary of the actions learned can be seen in the video below:

For future works, I'm actively working on training this model further, to see if it could achieve grasping with enough training time.
