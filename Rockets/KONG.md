# Overview
KONG was RIT Launch Initiative's 2022-2023 Entry into the Spaceport American Cup. KONG is a 10,000 ft COTS motor rocket, with a fully fiberglass airframe.

KONG flew the first iteration of the Backplane modular flight computer, which included my Power Module.

KONG performed well, and successfully released our payload, ANNE. ANNE was an airbrake technical demonstrator, and placed 1st internationally in the competition! Footage of ANNE in action can be seen below:
