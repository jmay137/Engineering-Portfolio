# Mayhem
# Overview
Mayhem is the third of my High Power certification rockets. This rocket will hopefully give me my L3 certification, opening me up to all that High Power Rocketry has to offer.  
​  
Mayhem is roughly 7.5 feet tall, with a fully fiberglass airframe, and dual redundant avionics systems. I plan to install cameras in the rocket to record its flight, as well as mount SRAD team built flight computers in the nose, so that they may be flight tested before being used as a primary avionics system.  
  
If it goes up and comes down successfully, I will get the highest Tripoli rocketry certification level you can achieve: Level 3. If it fails, I have to build another and try again.

# Update
After a Monster Energy-fueled 6 hour long design session, Mayhem's design is completed! Next steps are to create the CAD model, start looking into FEA for the structural components, and create the other documentation that I need to send off for approval. Once that's all in order I can submit the design to be approved, and then comes the fun part: building it.
