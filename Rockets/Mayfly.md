# Overview
Mayfly was the first of my High Power Rocketry certification rockets. It is an L1-class High Power rocket, based on a kit developed by RIT Launch Initiative. It is made of phenolic cardboard tube, laser cut fins, and a custom 3d printed nose cone with a mount for a camera to film the launch from the rocket's perspective.

# Flight
On September 8th, 2019, I was finally able to launch Mayfly. It was launch at the URRG launch site in Penn Yan, NY. It went up approximately 2000 feet, deployed a parachute, and came down in one piece. This gave me my L1 certification, and enabled me to start work on my L2, Mayflower.  
  
I was surprisingly stressed watching my rocket go up. It's a unique feeling, cause once it's on the pad, you're powerless. You have to trust your engineering and design skills and that you didn't make any mistakes. It really puts engineering into perspective, as well as the need to do good work. While an L1 is admittedly small scale, when you hear the range safety officer count down the seconds until your creation gets launched 2000 ft in the air in seconds, it's honestly nerve-racking. But in the end it worked and I got my full rocket back, instead of shredded scraps.
